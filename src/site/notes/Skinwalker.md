Skinwalkers resemble humans much of the time, but they possess the uncanny ability to transform into bestial humanoids. Most people believe skinwalkers are half-breeds of lycanthropes, or that they share a similar curse. Skinwalker shamans say they are chosen to be a bridge between the world of humanity and the animal world. The truth lies somewhere between these ideas.

They in fact have a lycanthrope somewhere in their family tree. These distant relatives of monstrous werewolves and other creatures of the night arise randomly among remote humanoid populations, as well as within their own secretive sects. A pair of humans may give birth to a skinwalker, and skinwalker parents can sometimes produce human children as well.

## Appearance
Outwardly human, skinwalkers are virtually indistinguishable from others of the group into which they are born. Those rare skinwalkers who have bred true for generations tend to have dark eyes, straight dark hair, and richly colored skin. When shapechanging, they gain bestial features; the snout elongates, teeth become more prominent, claws emerge from fingertips, and skin toughens into hide.

## Non-Human Skinwalkers
Skinwalkers are found mostly in human populations. However, they can feasibly be of any intelligent humanoid race - halflings, dwarves, orcs, elves, etc. Non-human skinwalkers perhaps more closely resemble their non-lycanthropic parent race, but possess the same statistics as human-descended skinwalkers with the exception of size and effects dependent on size, such as the damage die of natural attacks. For example, a gnome skinwalker is Small, but otherwise is statistically identical to the base skinwalker race.

## Traits
- They can change into a bestial form and back at will. Unlike a lycanthrope, this generally involves minor changes to the body (as described under appearance) rather than a full animal transformation. 
- They are adept at  dealing with animals, and skinwalkers with sufficient WIS are able to speak with them.
- They value passion over reason, receiving +2 to WIS and -2 to INT. In addition, they gain +2 to a physical trait of the player's choice while transformed.
