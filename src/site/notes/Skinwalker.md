Skinwalkers resemble humans much of the time, but they possess the uncanny ability to transform into bestial humanoids. Most people believe skinwalkers are half-breeds of lycanthropes, or that they share a similar curse. Skinwalker shamans say they are chosen to be a bridge between the world of humanity and the animal world. The truth may lie somewhere between these ideas.

They in fact have a lycanthrope somewhere in the branches of their family tree. These distant relatives of monstrous werewolves and other creatures of the night arise randomly among remote humanoid populations, as well as within their own secretive sects. A pair of humans may give birth to a skinwalker, or skinwalker parents may produce a skinwalker child—though these couplings can sometimes produce human children as well.

## Appearance
Outwardly human, skinwalkers are virtually indistinguishable from others of the group into which they are born. Those rare skinwalkers who have bred true for generations tend to have dark eyes, straight dark hair, and richly colored skin. When shapechanging, they gain bestial features; the snout elongates, teeth become more prominent, claws emerge from fingertips, and skin toughens into hide.

**Society**: Skinwalkers sometimes weave themselves into other societies, hoping their peculiar talents go unnoticed. They may also be nomads found in lands with wide-open spaces. Groups of skinwalkers hidden among a larger community of non-skinwalkers may regularly gather for lunar rituals or nocturnal pack hunting.
